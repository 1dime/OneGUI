# OneGUI
OneGUI is a graphics library for C/C++ programs that aims to be cross-platform. Currently, it only works with Linux.
However, as the source code may indicate, Windows (as well as other platforms) will have support too.

# Building
To build for Linux, run `./build.sh linux`.
Outputs for both will be stored in bin. For Linux, that is bin/linux. For Windows, its bin/windows.
